# Flight Analysis in the U.S. (Python)

Every year, nearly 25% of airline flights are delayed or cancelled, costing travellers over $30 billion in lost time and money. Flight delays have long been a cause of dissatisfaction in the airline industry, as well as a source of annoyance for passengers and carriers. Our goal is to use the massive amount of airline data to visualise and study flight patterns and predict if a flight will be delayed. For this study, both Python and R will be used to investigate 2 yearsâ€™ worth of data, since two full business cycles are adequate in reducing bias for one cycle.
